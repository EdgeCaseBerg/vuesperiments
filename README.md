# My Vue Learning Experience

These are my notes to myself and to anyone else who might learn a few things by reading my experience
on windows trying to get some vue stuff going.

## Installing and getting setup to actually code.

I already had VScode installed, so I hunted for some form of runtime related to the extensions.
No dice, so I went to [the node website] and ran the installer to install 14.17.5 directly after wasting
20 minutes looking around for a way to run nvm on windows. 

Once I got that going and had _restarted_ vscode, I could now run commands from my git bash terminal
I had configured in vscode before hand. So,

    npm install -g @vue/cli

Then, following [a tutorial on the vs studio website], I ran the create command:

    vue create blackjack

That made a folder for me. So I guess that's how we'll roll this. Multiple subfoders in here. That's fine,
we're learning and I'll probably make some new projects at some point.
